    "## Making the fit\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the eccentricity fit, Pyrex uses the following equation to compute the eccentricity contribution to both the phase and amplitude\n",
    "$$e_X = \\frac{X_{\\text{NR}}(X_c)-X_e}{2X_c},$$\n",
    "with $X$ being both $\\omega$, the instantaneous frequency and $\\mathcal{A}$, the amplitude. $X_c$ means that these quantities were taken from a circular simulation and $X_\\text{NR}$ means that they were taken from an eccentric simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting $e_X$ equations are then fit according to the following relation\n",
    "$$e_X = Ae^{BX^\\kappa_c}\\sin(fX^\\kappa_c + \\varphi),$$\n",
    "with $A, B, f$ and $\\varphi$ standard damped sinusoidal parameters. It turns out that $A$ and $B$ are highly correlated with the eccentricity, $f^2$ with the mass ratio, and $\\varphi$ an extra degree of freedom which behaviour is not well understood. $\\kappa$ takes different values for the instantaneouos frequency and amplitude, namely $\\kappa = -59/24$ for the frequency and $\\kappa=-83/24$ for the amplitude for a circular BBH with a total mass $M=50M_\\odot$."

    "### How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, $X_c$ are the components of a simulation with the same mass ratio and zero eccentricity. In other words, for every mass ratio in the used eccentric simulations there needs to be a circular simulation with the same mass ratio. $X_\\text{NR}$ are then the components of an eccentric binary simulation. However, this method only works if the only major differences in these simulations is the eccentricity and mass ratio. Furthermore, since Pyrex does not compute the mass ratio and eccentricity, these values have been taken from the literature at a reference frequency of $x=0.075$. The mean anomaly is *not* used. Since then, many of these simulations have been superseded, meaning that some of these parameters from the literature might be obsolete, but more significantly, there are better simulations."
